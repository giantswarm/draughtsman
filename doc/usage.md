## Introduction
This document is going to explain the basic usage and setup of draughtsman with a kubernetes cluster.

The default configurer (configmap/secret configurer), eventer (github eventer), installer (helm) and notifier (slack) are used in the following instructions. Draughtsman can be extended to use different configurers, eventers, installers and notifiers.

## Preparation
The following steps have to be completed before starting with the actual installation of draughtsman to a k8s cluster.
#### Setting up Minikube (optional)
You can skip this step if you have a running k8s cluster and want to run draughtsman on it.
Follow the installation instructions provided by minikube for your system. The output of `minikube status` should be:
```
> minikube status
minikube:
localkube:
```
if the installation was successfull. </br>
Start up kubernetes with the command:
`minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --kubernetes-version v1.7.0` (Alter the memory and cpu requirements if you do not have the resources necessary).
#### Setting up Helm
Both helm and the registry helm plugin are necessary to run draughtsman. Follow the helm installation instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) in order to install helm and then apply the registry instructions [here](https://github.com/app-registry/appr-helm-plugin) to install the registry plugin on top.</br>
Running `helm registry -h` should return the registry plugin help info, if the installation was successful.
```
usage: appr [-h]
            {pull,run-server,show,inspect,list,delete-package,helm,version,logout,deploy,plugins,push,login,config,channel,jsonnet}
            ...
```
Run `helm init` in order to install tiller into your cluster. Check the state of the tiller deployment (on top of the return message from helm) by running `kubectl describe deployment tiller-deploy -n=kube-system`. The deployment should be satisfied if tiller was installed correctly.

#### Configuring Draughtsman
Create a draughtsman namespace by running `kubectl create ns draughtsman`. Confirm that the namespace exists by running `kubectl get ns`.

Download the draughtsman chart with the helm registry `helm registry pull quay.io/giantswarm/draughtsman-chart@1.0.0-{sha}`. This should create a folder with the chart in your current directory.

Create a new file names `values.yaml` with the following content:
```
Installation:
  V1:
    Secret:
      Draughtsman:
        SecretYaml: |
          service:
            deployer:
              environment: incluster-minikube
              eventer:
                github:
                  oauthtoken: XXX
                  organisation: XXX
                  projectlist: XXX,XXX
              installer:
                helm:
                  organisation: XXX
                  password: XXX
                  username: user
              notifier:
                slack:
                  channel: XXX-XX
            slack:
              token: XXX-XXX-XXX
      Registry:
        PullSecret:
          DockerConfigJSON: |-
            {
              "auths": {
                "quay.io": {
                  "auth": "XXX"
                }
              }
            }
```
Several values in this file need to be adjusted to your environment:
* `github/oauthtoken` Your oauthtoken which has deploy rights in your github organisation.
* `github/organisation` Your github organisation.
* `github/projectlist` A comma seperated list of projects in your organisation which are covered by the oauthtoken.
* `helm/organisation` Your organisation on your chart repository (quay.io for example).
* `helm/user` A user authorized for your chart repository.
* `helm/password` The users password.
* `slack/channel` The slack channel you want draughtsman to report to.
* `slack/token` A slack api token for your slack.
* `Registry/PullSecret` The pull secret is needed if your docker images are in a private repository.

Replace the empty values file in the downloaded chart with the new one:
`cp values.yaml giantswarm_draughtsman-chart_1.0.0-{sha}/draughtsman-chart/values.yaml `

## Installation
The actual installation, after you've configured draughtsman correctly, is simply running the following command:</br>
`helm upgrade --install --reset-values draughtsman giantswarm_draughtsman-chart_1.0.0-sha/draughtsman-chart/`  


This should result into a running pod of draughtsman, executing `kubectl get pods -n draughtsman -n draughtsman` should return something similar to:
```
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
draughtsman-1205598562-8494z   1/1       Running   0          30s
```  

Check the logs of draughtsman with `kubectl logs draughtsman-1205598562-8494z`(your podname of course) which should look something like this if everything went well after startup (cleaned up for readability):
```
{... "debug":"creating in-cluster config", ...}
{... "debug":"checking connection to Kubernetes", ...}
{... "debug":"checking connection to Kubernetes", ...}
{... "debug":"logging into registry","registry":"XXX,... ,"username":"XXX"}
{... "debug":"running helm command","name":"login", ...}
{... "debug":"ran helm command","name":"login","stderr":"","stdout":" \u003e\u003e\u003e Login succeeded\n", ...}
{... "debug":"checking connection to Slack", ...}
{... "debug":"starting deployer", ...}
{... "debug":"starting polling for github deployment events","interval":"1m0s", ...}
{... "debug":"fetching deployments","project":"XXX", ...}
```

### Debugging errors
Draughtsman will panic if a configuration is missing, all entries in the `values.yaml` are mandatory.

Draughtsman will try to run `helm registry login` with the supplied credentials on startup. The logs should therefor contain something along the lines of `login successfull`. Draughtsman will not panic if the login wasn't successfull, but it will not operate correctly. Errormessages that include `install registry,...` indicate that tiller is not running in your cluster.

## Configuring applications

Draughtsman should now be running as a pod inside your cluster now, it does still need configuration to install the charts of your applications.

The following example will show some configurations you might use for a prometheus running inside your cluster.

Draughtsman will attempt to access the `draughtsman-values-configmap` in the `draughtsman` namespace. This ConfigMap could look like this:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: draughtsman-values-configmap
  namespace: draughtsman
data:
  values: |
    Installation:
      V1:
        Monitoring:
          Prometheus:
            Address: "XXX"
            Host: "XXX"
            ClusterLabel: 'incluster'
            RetentionPeriod: "336h"
```
Draughtsman will pass everything below the `values: |` and pass it to helm as is. This means that you could then use the value in your applications chart like this:
```
{{ .Values.Installation.V1.Monitoring.Prometheus.Address }}
```
Draughtsman will also access a secret called `draughtsman-values-secret` which contains secret data for both draughtsman itself (to reconfigure it) and for your applications. The secret should look like this:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: draughtsman-values-secret
  namespace: draughtsman
data:
  values: BASE64
```
And the `BASE64` should be created from a structure like this:
```
Installation:
  V1:
    Secret:
      Draughtsman:
        SecretYaml: |
          service:
            deployer:
              environment: incluster-minikube
              eventer:
                github:
                  oauthtoken: XXX
                  organisation: XXX
                  projectlist: XXX,XXX
              installer:
                helm:
                  organisation: XXX
                  password: XXX
                  username: user
              notifier:
                slack:
                  channel: XXX-XX
            slack:
              token: XXX-XXX-XXX
      Prometheus:
        Nginx:
          Auth: XXX:XXX
      Registry:
        PullSecret:
          DockerConfigJSON: |-
            {
              "auths": {
                "quay.io": {
                  "auth": "XXX"
                }
              }
            }
```
Note: _All_ values from the `values.yaml` of previous steps have to present here aswell. Some Prometheus secrets were added in this example which you could then reference in a secret in your applications charts like this:
 ```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: prometheus-nginx-secret
  namespace: monitoring
data:
auth: {{ .Values.Installation.V1.Secret.Prometheus.Nginx.Auth | b64enc | quote }}

 ```
 Apply both newly created files and check if `draughtsman-values-secret` is a secret and `draughtsman-values-configmap` is a ConfigMap in the draughtsman namespace.

 You are now able to change the configuration of a cluster by changing the secret or ConfigMap without touching the actual chart of each application.

 It is useful to ensure the pods of your installation are rolled if you change anything in a ConfigMap or secret, this can be achieved by adding a checksum of the ressources to your Deployment. An excerpt of how this could look like (again for prometheus):
 ```
 metadata:
      name: prometheus
      labels:
        app: prometheus
      annotations:
configmap-checksum: {{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/prometheus/prometheus-configmap.yaml") . | sha256sum }}

 ```


## Deployments
Github deployments events are created by interacting with the github API directly. Run the following curl command in order to create a deployment event manually:
```
curl --request POST   --url https://api.github.com/repos/yourorg/yourproject/deployments  --header 'authorization: token XXX'   --header 'content-type: application/json'   --data '{  "ref": "XXX",  "environment": "incluster-minikube",     "auto_merge": false }'

```

Note that the project has to be in the projectlist of the `values.yaml` and `draughtsman-values-secret` from above. The authorization token has to be a github oauthtoken with deploy rights and the `ref` has to be the commit SHA.
A successful deployment should produce log outputs in draughtsman similar to these and be reported to slack:
```
{... "debug":"fetching deployments","project":"XXX", ...}
{... "debug":"found new deployment events","project":"XXX", ...}
{... "debug":"posting deployment status","id":XXX,"project":"XXX","state":"pending", ...}
{... "debug":"installing chart","name":"XXX","sha":"XXX", ...}
{... "debug":"running helm command","name":"pull", ...}

```


## Metrics and alerting
Draughtsman exposes several metrics, which can be used to alert on draughtsmans behavior:
```
draughtsman_configmap_configurer_request_duration_milliseconds
draughtsman_configmap_configurer_request_total

draughtsman_github_eventer_github_deployment_duration_milliseconds
draughtsman_github_eventer_github_deployment_response_code
draughtsman_github_eventer_github_deployment_status_duration_milliseconds
draughtsman_github_eventer_github_deployment_status_response_code
draughtsman_github_eventer_rate_limit_limit
draughtsman_github_eventer_rate_limit_remaining

draughtsman_helm_installer_helm_command_duration_milliseconds
draughtsman_helm_installer_helm_command_total

draughtsman_slack_notifier_request_duration_milliseconds
draughtsman_slack_notifier_request_total

```
Alerting on `draughtsman_github_eventer_rate_limit_remaining` is especially important as the github eventer impacts your github api request limit.
